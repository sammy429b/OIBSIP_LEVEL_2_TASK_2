    <big>Tesla</big> was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to compromise to drive electric – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.
    <br><br>
    Tesla’s vehicles are produced at its Fremont factory in California, where the vast majority of the vehicle’s components are also made. As Tesla continues to expand its product line, Tesla’s production plan is also set to increase to a rate of 500,000 vehicles a year by 2018.</p><br><br>
